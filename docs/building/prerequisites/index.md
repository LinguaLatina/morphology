# Prerequisites

- A POSIX-like environment with `sh`, `echo` and `make`
- The simple build tool, [`sbt`](https://github.com/sbt/sbt)
The [Stuttgart FST tools](http://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de/~schmid/tools/SFST/)

If you are unable or prefer not to install these on your computer, you can use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to run [a docker container with all the prerequisites included](https://github.com/homermultitext/hmt-editor-container)
